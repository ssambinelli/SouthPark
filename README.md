In the game we need to help Kenny to not die avoinding colision with the obstacles, which includes:
- Cartman Cop
- Professor Caos
- Officer Barbrady in the Police Car
- Ginger Cow
- Clyde, the Frog
- Sparky
- Ginger Cow
- UFO

(Special thanks to my friends and family who helped me pick the obstacles), the game gets faster with time so you can have a lot of fun while humming the South Park Intro with the game, it was also made using simple images from Google images to bring the South Park theme to life!
